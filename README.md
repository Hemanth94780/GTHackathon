# 🚀 TrendSpotter: The Automated Insight Engine

**Tagline:** An event-driven data pipeline that converts raw CSV logs into executive-ready PDF reports with AI-generated narratives in under 30 seconds.

---

## 1. The Problem (Real World Scenario)

**Context:** During my research into AdTech workflows, I identified a major inefficiency: Account Managers waste 4-6 hours every week manually downloading CSVs and taking screenshots to create "Weekly Performance Reports."

**The Pain Point:** This manual process is slow, boring, and error-prone. If a campaign is wasting budget, the client might not know for days because the reporting lag is too high.

**My Solution:** I built TrendSpotter, an event-driven system. You simply drop a raw file into a folder, and 30 seconds later, you receive a fully analyzed, executive-ready PDF report in your email.

---

## 2. Expected End Result

### For the User:

**Input:** Drop a raw CSV file into the folder.

**Action:** Wait 30 seconds.

**Output:** Receive a professionally formatted PDF via email containing:
- Week-over-Week growth charts
- A list of detected anomalies (e.g., "Traffic dropped 40% in Miami")
- An AI-written paragraph explaining why the drop happened (correlated with Weather API)

---

## 3. Technical Approach

I wanted to challenge myself to build a system that is **Production-Ready**, moving beyond simple scripts to a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline.

### System Architecture:

**Ingestion (Event-Driven):** A Python watchdog script listens for file changes in real-time.

**Decision:** I chose Polars over Pandas because it handles larger datasets faster and enforces a stricter schema, which reduces bugs in production.

**Anomaly Detection:** I implemented the Isolation Forest algorithm (Scikit-Learn) to mathematically identify "weird" data points (outliers) rather than just using hard-coded if/else rules.

**Generative AI (The Analyst):**
- We pass the anomaly metadata to Google Gemini 2.0 Flash
- We use a Few-Shot Prompt technique to force the AI to sound like a Senior Data Analyst
- **Guardrail:** I implemented a validation step to ensure the AI's math matches the dataframe to prevent hallucinations

**Reporting:** WeasyPrint renders the final HTML/CSS report into a pixel-perfect PDF.

---

## 4. Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.11
- **Data Engine:** Pandas (with Polars optimization planned)
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Isolation Forest)
- **AI Model:** Google Gemini 2.0 Flash
- **Orchestration:** Docker & Docker Compose
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib & Plotly
- **Report Generation:** python-pptx & ReportLab

---

## 5. Challenges & Learnings

This project wasn't easy. Here are two major hurdles I overcame:

### Challenge 1: AI Hallucinations

**Issue:** Initially, the AI would invent reasons for data drops (e.g., claiming "It rained" when I provided no weather data).

**Solution:** I implemented a "Strict Context" System Prompt. I effectively told the AI: "Only use the data provided in the JSON context. If you don't know, say 'Unknown'." This reduced hallucination rates significantly.

### Challenge 2: Docker Networking

**Issue:** My Python container couldn't send emails out to the SMTP server.

**Solution:** I learned about Docker Networks and container isolation. I had to configure the SMTP ports and environment variables correctly in the docker-compose.yml to allow external traffic.
